## Advantages of Ubuntu : 

1. UNIX Environment :
    > Best for you if you are a programmer, and do not need windows for the same. Piping and redirection combined with traditional UNIX utilities are enough to blow anyone’s mind.
2. Cost : 
    > Ubuntu is free while you are paying for windows, buy a laptop without an operating system and install Ubuntu on it. It would save money while providing the same quality. Although you can donate if you feel like.

## Disadvantages of Ubuntu : 

* It is not possible to play the modern games in Ubuntu OS. It shows the poor graphics quality and ne have to use emulators to do so that harms the graphics quality.

- And finally one more major drawback of Ubuntu is that a user switching from Windows or MAC will not like user experience on Ubuntu and will have difficulty in operating the OS.
